## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code
- Open with Live Server (VS Code plugin)

### What I learned

This is my first challenge ever. I learned a lot how to use the Chrome Developer Tool (F12) and to turn on and off different style in order to understand better what each property does in the browser.

I realized I still have a long way to go, but I started to look up the documentation for padding, margin and other CSS properties.

### Continued development

I will go for the next challenge.
